Sure, let's create a scenario for a simple 3-tier application written in Go, designed to run as a containerized application. This application will be structured into three layers: the presentation layer (front-end), the business logic layer (application server), and the data storage layer (database).

# Scenario Overview
## Presentation Layer (Front-end)

### Technology: A simple Go-based web server.
Role: Serves the user interface and handles user interaction.
Containerization: Docker container hosting the web server.

## Business Logic Layer (Application Server)

### Technology: Go application with REST API.
Role: Processes business logic, handles requests from the front-end, and interacts with the database.
Containerization: Separate Docker container for the application server.

## Data Storage Layer (Database)

### Technology: PostgreSQL database.
Role: Stores and retrieves data required by the application server.
Containerization: Docker container running PostgreSQL.
Implementation Steps

## Develop the Application

### Write a Go program for the web server.
Develop a Go application with RESTful services for business logic.
Set up a PostgreSQL database schema.

## Containerize Each Component

###Create a Dockerfile for the web server, application server, and PostgreSQL.
Build Docker images for each component.

##Orchestration and Deployment

Use Docker Compose for local deployment and testing.
Define services in the docker-compose.yml file including network settings to link the containers.
Testing

Test the application locally using Docker Compose.
Ensure components communicate correctly and data flows through all layers.
Further Exploration and Practice

## Implement CI/CD Pipeline

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
Automate the build and deployment of Docker images.

##Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy this application to a Kubernetes cluster.
Create Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Persistent Volumes) for each component.
Consider using Minikube, kind, or k3s for a local Kubernetes environment.
Monitoring and Logging

Implement monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
Set up logging using Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack).

## Scaling and Load Balancing

Explore horizontal pod autoscaling in Kubernetes.
Implement a load balancer for the web server and application server.
Security Considerations

Implement network policies in Kubernetes.
Use secrets for database credentials.
